        {`A dental crown is a custom-made cap that covers and protects a damaged or weakened tooth above the gum line. It restores the tooth's shape, strength, and appearance after decay, fracture, or major wear. Crowns can be crafted from porcelain, zirconia, lithium disilicate, metal alloys, or layered combinations that balance aesthetics with durability. The crown is bonded or cemented to the prepared tooth, creating a new outer surface that takes the bite forces and seals the underlying tooth structure from further breakdown.`}
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        {`Crowns are different from fillings and veneers. A filling repairs a localized cavity, while a veneer covers only the front surface for cosmetic change. A crown wraps 360 degrees, making it suitable when too much tooth is missing for a filling to stay strong or when a tooth needs protection after root canal therapy. Modern digital design and milling can produce crowns with precise fit and natural translucency, especially with materials like zirconia and lithium disilicate.`}

      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        {`You need a crown when a tooth is too compromised to be reliably restored with a filling or bonding alone. Large decay, cracks, or fractures reduce the amount of healthy enamel that can hold a filling. A crown redistributes chewing forces across the whole tooth, lowering the risk of further cracking and sealing the tooth against bacteria. After a root canal, a tooth becomes more brittle, so a crown is often recommended to prevent splitting. Crowns are also used to rebuild teeth with severe erosion, worn biting edges, or large old fillings that are failing.`}
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        {`Cosmetically, crowns can improve the shape and color of teeth with deep intrinsic stains or significant malformation. In implant dentistry, a crown is the visible part attached to the implant abutment. In bridgework, crowns on neighboring teeth support a false tooth between them. The common thread is functional reinforcement: the crown acts like a helmet for the tooth, protecting what remains while restoring a natural look and bite.`}

        {`Signs you may need a crown include a tooth with a large fracture or a chunk missing, a filling that covers more than half the tooth width, or a tooth that aches when you bite because of underlying cracks. Your dentist may flag teeth with hairline cracks on x-rays or through clinical tests, recommending a crown to prevent a catastrophic split. After a root canal, most back teeth and many heavily restored front teeth benefit from crowns to avoid future fractures.`}

      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        {`If you hear that a tooth is “restorable but high risk,” a crown is often the conservative way to save it before it fails. Conversely, if the crack extends below the bone or the tooth has very little healthy structure left, a crown may not be possible, and extraction with an implant or bridge might be safer. A thorough exam with x-rays, crack detection, and bite assessment will clarify whether a crown is the best option or if a simpler filling or onlay would suffice.`}

If decay extends below the gum line and there is insufficient healthy tooth above the bone, a crown may not seal well and could fail quickly. Teeth with vertical root fractures, severe mobility from gum disease, or cracks running below the bone are poor candidates; extraction and replacement are usually better. If your bite forces are extreme due to bruxism and you cannot commit to wearing a night guard, even strong crowns can chip or loosen.`}
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        {`Crowns should also be postponed if active gum disease or untreated decay is present elsewhere—stabilizing gum health first improves the long-term outlook. In some cosmetic situations, a minimal onlay or veneer may be preferable to a full crown to preserve more enamel. A careful plan weighs the remaining tooth structure, crack depth, bite, and hygiene habits before committing to full coverage. When the foundations are sound and risks are managed, crowns are predictably successful; when they are not, another approach is safer.`}

Modern materials like high-strength zirconia and lithium disilicate resist chipping and fracture better than older porcelain-fused-to-metal designs, but technique matters as much as material. Crowns on back teeth that take heavy chewing forces tend to wear faster than those on front teeth, especially if clenching or grinding is present.`}

Each replacement removes a small amount of material to create fresh space, so repeated crown cycles gradually thin the tooth. If decay, cracks, or prior reduction leave too little tooth above the gum, a crown may no longer be viable and extraction with an implant or bridge becomes the predictable choice. Preserving enamel and dentin at each stage extends how many times crowning is possible.`}

Crowns also introduce a margin where the crown meets natural tooth; if hygiene is poor or the seal is imperfect, decay can start at that junction.`}
