In Antalya it was the other way around, they adviced me the treatment which was best for me and my situation, not the treatment that would bring them the most profit. A sign of great professionalism, high standards of quality and such a huge green flag for me as a patient and customer!

We both came here twice (phase 1 in September 2022 and phase 2 in March 2023)— my husband had a full-mouth dental implant reconstruction, and I had periodontal flap surgery and 20  ceramic crowns. From day one, we were so touched by how warm, friendly, and professional the whole team was. Everyone — from the doctors to the assistants and coordinators — made us feel completely comfortable and well cared for.                                                      Their skills and attention to detail are truly amazing. Every step was carefully explained, and you could tell they really cared about doing their best for us, not just finishing the job. We left feeling happy but still a little unsure how long everything would last.\n\nWell, it’s been almost three years now — and we couldn’t be happier! Six months after our treatment, we went for a check-up with our dentist here in Canada. After taking X-rays, they were honestly shocked at how perfect the work done in Turkey was. Even now, our Canadian dentist still praises the results every time we visit.\n\nWe’re beyond grateful to the entire team for giving us not only beautiful, healthy smiles but also real confidence and peace of mind. Thank you all so much — you’re amazing! 👏💐",

In the States I was quoted 40k; I flew over, twice and got the whole job done,  and my total with round-trip flights and everything was right under 10 grand. Clinic was clean, everyone spoke very good English, zero pain, teeth feel rock-solid and look completely natural. I  flew halfway around the world for this, and I’d do it again in a heartbeat. Adalya Dental clinic straight-up gave me my smile back without bankrupting me. 100% worth it.",
